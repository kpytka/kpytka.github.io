# Intro

This version is extremely preliminary. Your comments are more than welcome.

The purpose of this notebook is to capture, organize, and categorize a knowledge repository of my `Julia` workflow. 
At this moment, I write it mainly for myself to be able to get back to `Julia` after short breaks.
That being said, it might be of interest to other economists wanting to learn `Julia` or to improve their own workflow.
People who want to start their journey with the language absolutely from scratch should start with a great intro by Sargent and Stachursky, which can be found [here](https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html), or [Julia Express](http://bogumilkaminski.pl/files/julia_express.pdf) by Bogumił Kamiński.

_Disclaimer_: 
While writing 1st draft of the book I was planning to entitle it in  a tongue-in-cheek way, _Dating Julia as a macroeconomist_. 
Back then I was not aware of gender neutrality of the `Julia` language explicitly stated in the [community standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/). 
As a supporter of the gender inclusivity I changed the title but at the same time I kept this information to amplify this message even more.
